# HeadsetUtils
Some wireless headsets are set as the default audio device as long as the dongle is connected, even if the headset is off.

This utility is meant to change the system's default audio device when the headset is turned off/on.

Current version is hard coded for Corsair's HS70 Pro, and assumes installation of iCue 4 and [AudioDeviceCmdlets](https://github.com/frgnca/AudioDeviceCmdlets) powershell module
